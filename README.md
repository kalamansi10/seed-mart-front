##### I'm currently developing an e-commerce React web app using Vite that connects to a Rails API backend. It's a work in progress, and I wanted to share the current status of features:

##### Implemented Features:
    - Modal log in w/ rememberable session + CSRF authentication
    - Promo banner slider
    - Items list fetcher and mapper
    - Item search + category filter
    - Items cartpage
    - Item page
##### Features Currently Being Implemented:
    - Checkout page
    - Profile and profile settings page
    - Interactive Nav bar(Profile and cart dropdown)
##### Planned Features:
    - Far better CSS
    - Payment API integration
    - Buyer review
    - Footer

##### After cloning the repository, to run the app make sure that the Rails API backend is already running. Then run the following command:
    npm install
    npm run dev
